I am a writer and educator with a passion for technical documentation. As an academic, I have over a decade of experience teaching university courses on technical communication, business and professional writing, and academic research writing. On any given day, you can find me writing, teaching, or contributing documentation to open source projects. Beyond my work, I use my writing expertise to give back to my community as a Board Member and Chair of the Grants Committee at the Soup Kitchen of Muncie.
